# Biography
I am a biostatistician and an aspriring data scientist interested in longitudinal modeling methods, incorporating disease pathology into the modeling process, and statistical programming. I studied Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the University of Florida, focusing on industrial agricultural waste as potential energy sources. While I remain interested in agricultural and environmental problems, I wanted to learn to approach scientific problems from a statistical standpoint. This led me to study Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University, focusing on statistical models for disease progression. After founding our department's ASA student chapter and working with the Vanderbilt Graduate Student Council, I became interested in fostering connections between the statistics community and other scientific fields and increasing diversity in the STEM fields.
